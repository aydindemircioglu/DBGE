# Tutorial

**DBGE** is an implementation of the 'Divergence Based Graph Estimation for Manifold Learning' method
by KT Abouâ€“Moustafa, F Ferrie, D Schuurmans.
The idea is to augment the space by a neighborhood estimation and then define a new distance measure
on this space. The resulting distance matrix can then be used in one of the standard methods like ISOMAP, LLE etc.

In the following we provide an introduction to **DBGE**. An introductory example serves as a quickstart guide.
Note that our focus is on your comprehension of the basic functions and
applications. For detailed technical information and manual pages, please refer to
the package's [manual pages](http://berndbischl.github.io/aydindemircioglu/man/). They are regularly updated and reflect the documentation of the current packages on CRAN.
